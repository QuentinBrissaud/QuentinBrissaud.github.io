I am a geophysicist working at [NORSAR](https://www.norsar.no/), in Oslo, Norway. My interests include near-surface seismology, natural and man-made geophysical event analysis using infrasound data, source and subsurface velocity inversions using seismic and infrasound records, and waveform modeling in coupled seismo-acoustic media.
