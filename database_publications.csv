However, the high computational cost of numerical modeling solvers makes them impractical for a near-real-time analysis. To address this, a previous study trained a Convolutional Neural Network on regional wind fields, predicting transmission losses in less than 0, 05 seconds with a mean-squared error of 5 dB. However, this approach uses interpolated atmospheric specifications and focused only on winds, limiting its applicability for long-range modeling. In this work, we develop a convolutional recurrent network to predict transmission losses leveraging realistic, range-dependent atmospheric specifications …|https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/EGU25-10204.html?pdf|DEEP LEARNING-BASED METHOD FOR NEAR-REAL TIME ESTIMATION OF INFRASOUND TRANSMISSION LOSSES IN THEATMOSPHERE

Among existing propagation modeling tools, the parabolic equation method enables transmission loss to be finely simulated using wind and temperature atmospheric models. However, its computational cost prohibits the exploration of a large parameter space in operational monitoring applications. To address this, a recent study exploited a deep learning algorithm capable of making ground-level loss predictions almost instantaneously, similar to parabolic equation-based outputs. However, this relied on interpolated atmospheric models, leading to an incomplete representation of the medium, and did not use the temperature as part of the inputs, which makes the network not adapted for long range propagation. In the current work, we address these limitations by using both wind and temperature fields as input, simulated up to 130 km altitude and 4,000 km distance. We also optimize several aspects of the network architecture. We exploit convolutional and recurrent layers to capture spatially and range-dependent features embedded in realistic atmospheric data, improving the overall performance. The network reaches an average error of 4 dB compared to full parabolic equation simulations and provides epistemic and data-related uncertainty estimates. Its evaluation on the 2022 Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption demonstrates its generalization capabilities. The model adapts to a broad range of frequencies not included …|https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.174051859.94658380|TOWARDS REAL-TIME ASSESSMENT OF INFRASOUND EVENT DETECTION CAPABILITY USING DEEP LEARNING-BASED TRANSMISSION LOSS ESTIMATION

However, in Earth’s remote regions, deploying seismic or infrasound networks at the surface can be a difficult task. Stratospheric balloon platforms equipped with pressure sensors have therefore gained interest since they provide a unique and inexpensive way to record pressure signals in the atmosphere with a low noise level.

While this technology is used by the International Monitoring System 4 to monitor nuclear explosions as part of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the detection and location of lower-yield military attacks requires a network of sensors much closer to the source of the explosions. Without dedicated sensor deployments, such networks are rarely available for conflict monitoring. Obtaining comprehensive and objective data that can be used to effectively monitor an active conflict zone therefore remains a significant challenge. We demonstrate how seismic waves generated by explosions in northern Ukraine can be recorded by a local network of seismometers and used to automatically identify individual attacks in close to real-time, providing an unprecedented view of an active conflict zone. Between February and November 2022, we observe over 1200 explosions from the Kyiv, Zhytomyr and Chernhiv provinces, providing accurate origin times, locations and magnitudes.

Fortunately, a fraction of the seismic energy transmits in the upper atmosphere as infrasound waves, i.e. low-frequency pressure perturbations (< 20Hz). On July 22, 2019, a heliotrope balloon, equipped with pressure sensors, was launched from the Johnson Valley, CA with the objective of capturing infrasound signals from the aftershock sequence of the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake. At 16:27:36 UTC, the sound of a natural earthquake of Mw 4.2 was detected for the first time by a balloon platform. This observation offered the opportunity to attempt the first inversion of seismic velocities from the atmosphere. Shear velocities extracted by our analytical inversion method fell within a reasonable range from the values provided by regional tomographic models. While our analysis was limited by the observation’s low signal-to-noise ratio, future observations of seismic events from a network of balloons carrying multiple pressure sensors could provide excellent constraints on crustal properties. However, to build robust estimates of seismic properties, inversion procedures will have to account for uncertainties in terms of velocity models, source locations, and instrumental errors. In this contribution, we will discuss the current state of balloon-based observations, the sensitivity of the acoustic wavefield on subsurface properties, and perspectives on future inversions of seismically-induced acoustic data.|https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.1002/essoar.10509367.1|WHAT CAN THE SOUND OF EARTHQUAKES TELL US ABOUT A PLANET'S INTERIOR STRUCTURE?
journal|Path effects on surface-wave amplification in sedimentary basins|2022|Quentin Brissaud and Daniel Bowden|N/A|N/A|N/A|Authorea Preprints|Authorea|Sedimentary basins strongly affect earthquake ground motions of both body and surface waves that propagate through them. Yet to characterize seismic hazards at a specific site, it is common practice to consider only the effects of near-surface geology on vertically propagating body waves despite surface waves often causing strong damage. Recently, Bowden & Tsai (2017) proposed an semi-analytical method to predict surface-wave basin amplification and noticed that certain large regional earthquake ground motions are under-predicted if surface waves are not properly accounted for. Since the theory is based on a 1-D approximation of the near-surface geologic structure and does not account for path effects, it is of interest to know how significantly such additional complexity affects the 1-D predictions. When considering deep basins, several other basin parameters play a role in the amplification of surface waves: transmission and conversion at the basin edge, basin shape, lateral resonance and focusing effects. As surface waves propagate back and forth in a highly dispersive medium, the amplification also varies strongly from the edge to the center of the basin. These effects are not always accounted for because of the cost of geophysical surveys that would accurately constrain the structure, the lack of earthquake data for empirical predictions, the poor understanding of what main factors are responsible for basin amplification, and the absence of quantitative estimates of their contribution to the overall amplification. The current study aims to provide quantitative estimates of the importance of these various path effects on surface waves …|https://www.authorea.com/doi/full/10.1002/essoar.10500410|PATH EFFECTS ON SURFACE-WAVE AMPLIFICATION IN SEDIMENTARY BASINS

Earth, Moon, and Mars have all hosted seismic instruments on the surface, which have mapped seismic activity and provided insight into their interior.

In recent years, balloon-based seismology through the study of low-frequency seismo-acoustic signals (infrasound) has gained acceptance as a viable way to study seismic activity on Venus. Balloon-based barometers have the potential to detect and characterize atmospheric waves launched by venusquakes and volcanic eruptions while offering substantially longer instrument lifetimes in the Venus middle atmosphere, where temperature and pressure are significantly more benign (-10-100 C) as compared to the surface (> 460 C).

Such basin or site amplification effects have been well documented in numerous regions, yet the complex and often situational dependence of competing reasons for this amplification makes it hard to quantify in a general sense or to determine the most significant contributions. Simple 1D seismic profiles can be used to estimate the amplitude differences between a basin site and a hard‐rock reference site, but this ignores any reflections or conversions at the basin edge or a resonance effect depending on the basin’s geometry. In this article, we explore an analytic model based on coupling coefficients for surface Rayleigh waves to account for the lateral discontinuities at a basin’s edge (Datta 2018).

In order to stabilize he simulations we truncate the velocity model at the surface such that vs (z)= vs (zt) for z< zt,(1) where zt is the truncation depth. Therefore, by using approximation (1), we create a constant velocity near-surface waveguide of thickness zt that could impact surface-wave velocity amplitude spectrum for large zt or high-frequency sources. To properly pick a truncation depth zt that does not impact the velocity spectrum for a given spatial resolution∆ x we run simple convergence tests.

conference|Earth-Atmosphere system modeling for acoustic and gravity wave propagation|2016|Quentin Brissaud and Raphael Garcia and Roland Martin and Dimitri Komatitsch|2016|N/A|S11C-2479|AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|N/A|Acoustic and gravity waves generated, for example, by seismic surface waves or explosions in the atmosphere could lead to a significant step into the understanding of the atmosphere dynamics but also of the interior structure of planets. Thus an accurate numerical modeling of the solid-fluid coupling and the atmosphere dynamics is thus important to properly understand the coupled solid-fluid system. We therefore introduce a numerical modeling tool that takes into account the propagation of both acoustic and gravity waves in a non-linear atmosphere (Navier-stokes equations) coupled to a linear viscoelastic solid Earth. The implementation is performed based on both discontinuous and continuous Galerkin methods and implemented in the SPECFEM 2D software package. Validation cases are presented by comparison with analytical solutions and with linear wave propagation simulated based on a finite …|https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AGUFM.S11C2479B/abstract|EARTH-ATMOSPHERE SYSTEM MODELING FOR ACOUSTIC AND GRAVITY WAVE PROPAGATION

Radar images have revealed a surface that is much younger than those of the Moon, Mercury, and Mars as well as a variety of enigmatic volcanic and tectonic features quite unlike those we are familiar with on Earth. What are the dynamic processes that shape these features, in the absence of any plate tectonics? What is their relationship with the dense Venus atmosphere, which envelops Venus like an ocean? To understand how Venus works as a planet, we now need to probe its interior. Conventional seismology for probing the interior of a planet employs extremely sensitive motion or speed detectors in contact with the planetary surface. For Venus, these sensors must be deployed on the surface and must tolerate the Venus environment (460 degrees C and 90 bars) for up to a year. The dense atmosphere of Venus, which efficiently couples seismic energy into the atmosphere as infrasonic waves, enables two alternatives: detection of these infrasonic waves in the middle atmosphere using a string of two or more microbarometers suspended from a floating platform or detection with an orbiting spacecraft of electromagnetic signatures produced by interactions of infrasonic waves in the Venus upper atmosphere and ionosphere. This report, describing the findings of a workshop, sponsored by the Keck Institute of Space Studies (KISS), concludes that seismic investigations can be successful conducted from all three vantage points—surface, middle atmosphere, and space. Separately or, better still, together, these …|https://authors.library.caltech.edu/records/qtr46-p9x81|PROBING THE INTERIOR STRUCTURE OF VENUS

The details of the code and its validation for Earth atmosphere are presented in session SA003. The simulations include the modeling of both acoustic and gravity waves in the same run, an effects of exponential density decrease, winds and attenuation. The application to Mars requires the inclusion of a specific attenuation effect related to the relaxation induced by vibrational modes of carbon dioxide molecules. Two different applications are presented demonstrating the ability of the simulation tool to work at very different scale length and frequencies. First the propagation of acoustic and gravity waves due to a bolide explosion in the atmosphere of Mars are simulated. This case has a direct application to the atmospheric pressure and seismic measurements that will be performed by …|https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.P23B2148G/abstract|FINITE DIFFERENCE SIMULATIONS OF ACOUSTIC AND GRAVITY WAVE PROPAGATION IN MARS ATMOSPHERE: APPLICATIONS TO INSIGHT NASA MISSION AND MARS MICROPHONE EXPERIMENTS
conference|Numerical modeling of acoustic and gravity waves propagation in the atmosphere using a spectral element method|2015|Roland Martin and Quentin Brissaud and Raphael Garcia and Dimitri Komatitsch|N/A|N/A|6147|EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts|N/A|During low-frequency events such as tsunamis, acoustic and gravity waves are generated and quickly propagate in the atmosphere. Due to the exponential decrease of the atmospheric density with the altitude, the conservation of the kinetic energy imposes that the amplitude of those waves increases (to the order of 105 at 200km of altitude), which allows their detection in the upper atmosphere. This propagation bas been modelled for years with different tools, such as normal modes modeling or to a greater extent time-reversal techniques, but a low-frequency multi-dimensional atmospheric wave modelling is still crucially needed. A modeling tool is worth of interest since there are many different sources, as earthquakes or atmospheric explosions, able to propagate acoustic and gravity waves. In order to provide a fine modeling of the precise observations of these waves by GOCE satellite data, we developed a new …|https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EGUGA..17.6147M/abstract|NUMERICAL MODELING OF ACOUSTIC AND GRAVITY WAVES PROPAGATION IN THE ATMOSPHERE USING A SPECTRAL ELEMENT METHOD

Recently, two new observations methods have proven their efficiency: perturbations of airglow emissions and variations of the drag of very low Earth orbit satellites. The perturbations of these observables are mainly due to air density variations induced by post-seismic infrasounds or atmospheric gravity waves generated by tsunamis. Even if the airglow emissions present the great advantage of providing an imaging capability, the weakness of the airglow signal induces long integration time, and does not allow to infer high frequency infrasound signals. Moreover, restrictions on observation conditions and line of sight integration reduce the capability of detailed imaging of atmospheric wavefronts. On the other hand, variations of the satellite drag …|https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFMNH33C..03G/abstract|WHAT CAN WE DO WITH AN ATMOSPHERIC SEISMOMETER MOVING AT 8 KM/S?

J. Int|N/A|Introduction: Seismology can help determine the internal structure of planetary bodies that possess ongoing geologic, tectonic, or volcanic activity. After over half a century of robotic exploration on Venus, its internal structure remains unknown. Tectonic structures on Venus [1] suggest recent deformation and potential for ongoing seismic activity. The presence of several volcanic edifices in the form of shield volcanoes, coronae and domes is indicative of past and potentially ongoing volcanism. Recently, studies based on empirical estimates extrapolated from Earth’s volcanic eruption record [2], simulations [3], and circumstantial observational evidence [4, 5] suggest present-day volcanism as well. However, extremely high temperature and pressure conditions on the surface of Venus [6] present a significant technological challenge to performing long-duration seismic experiments similar to those being performed by the InSight lander on Mars.|https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2022/pdf/2308.pdf|ADVANCES TOWARDS BALLOON-BASED INFRASOUND SEISMOLOGY ON VENUS IN 2020-2021.
