Our seismo-acoustic team at NORSAR has been actively working with seismic and infrasound data from Ukraine to monitor the 2022 Russia-Ukraine war in real time. We have collected unprecented insights about the spatial and time evolution of the conflict. We are currently building a deep-learning network for the automatic and highly-accurate detection and association of signals recorded in Ukraine. Our original work will be published soon in Nature.
