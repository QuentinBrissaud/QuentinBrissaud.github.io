Our seismo-acoustic team at NORSAR has been actively working with seismic and infrasound data from Ukraine to monitor the 2022 Russia-Ukraine war in real time. We got an incredible news coverage from various outlets including the New York Times: <https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/30/world/europe/ukraine-war-russia-attacks-seismic-waves.html>. Below is the paper in pdf format:
