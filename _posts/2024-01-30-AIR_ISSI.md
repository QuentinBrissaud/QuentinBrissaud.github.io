The AIR team has joined the team Seismicity on Venus: Prediction & Detection at the International Space Science Institute <https://teams.issibern.ch/seismicityonvenus/>. This is a critical collaboration as we have a shared goal to design and promote the next round of geophysical missions towards Venus. In this context, we attended the 2nd ISSI workshop in Bern, Switzerland. Two members of the AIR team joined the meeting physically: Peter Nasholm, signal processing professor at the University of Oslo, and Celine Marie Solberg, MSc student at the University of Oslo. They gave brilliants talks about our work on Venus detectability
