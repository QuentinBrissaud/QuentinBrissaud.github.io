We have produced the first global detectability maps of venusquakes from a balloon platform. We incorporated amplitude predictions of seismically-induced infrasound and recent estimates of Venus seismicity into a Bayesian probabilistic framework. This study paves the way towards building the next round of geophysical planetary missions to Venus. This poster was presented by Celine Marie Solberg, MSc student from he University Of Oslo:<br><br>
