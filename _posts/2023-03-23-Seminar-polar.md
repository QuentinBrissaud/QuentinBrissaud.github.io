I gave a seminar in Oslo for the Norwegian and Swedish polar institutes symposium to discuss the use of infrasound array to probe atmospheric and ice processes in polar regions. I showcased recent work on infrasound research in polar regions including glacier calving and stratosphreic wind characterization from remote infrasound data. Watch the seminar online below:<br>
